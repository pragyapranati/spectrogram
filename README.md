This document provides an overview of the backend implementation for a mobile app that takes input images and generates frequency and color spectrograms using Python libraries and Flask SPI. The app's backend is designed to handle image processing and spectrogram generation requests from the Flutter Dart frontend.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework in Python, used for creating the API endpoints to handle requests.
- **Flask SPI**: A custom Python package/library built for generating spectrograms from input images.
- **Python Imaging Library (PIL)**: Used for image manipulation and processing.
- **NumPy**: Utilized for numerical operations and transformations.
- **Flutter Dart**: The frontend framework for building the mobile app user interface.

## Backend Components

1. **Flask API Setup**

   The backend starts with creating a Flask API to handle incoming requests. This involves setting up routes to receive image data and return spectrogram images.

   ```python
   # Example Flask route setup
   @app.route('/generate_spectrogram', methods=['POST'])
   def generate_spectrogram():
       # Code to handle image data and spectrogram generation
